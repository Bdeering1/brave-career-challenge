### Web Scraper for Visitor Classification
The goal of this challenge was to build a tool that takes a URL as input, scrapes the site's content, and generates questions using artificial intelligence to classify visitors based on their interests or industry. My solution is a full-stack app that will scrape a given site using Selenium, and use key insights to prompt ChatGPT.
